 * Kern 07: `DotCheck<S, B, Op>` — the compile-time guard shared by `dot` and
 * `cosineSimilarity` (both rank-1 x rank-1, equal length; see
 * docs/kern-07-elementwise-vector-spec.md's error-message table). `Op` is
 * the message stem (`"dot"` or `"cosineSimilarity"`) so both call sites
 * reuse one guard instead of two near-duplicates.
 *
 * Structure mirrors two existing house patterns rather than inventing a
 * third:
 *  - the `RankUnknowable` guard on EITHER operand (dynamic rank OR a
 *    mixed-rank shape union, D-V1.3, docs/phase-d-vorarbeiten-spec.md),
 *    checked first and unconditionally degrading to "no claim" (pass) —
 *    identical to `Broadcast`/`MatMul`'s own `RankUnknowable` gate
 *    (broadcast.ts, matmul.ts);
 *  - the rank-1 destructuring check `S extends readonly [infer D extends Dim]`
 *    — MatMul's own "rank(A) === 1" idiom (matmul.ts) — used here as a NAKED
 *    check on the bare type parameter so a union OF SHAPES (e.g.
 *    `[2,3] | [4]`) distributes and is processed member-by-member, the same
 *    natural distribution `MatMulStatic`/`ProductAcc` already rely on
 *    elsewhere in this codebase (never special-cased).
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT reuse `DimEq` (dim.ts) for the length comparison:
 * `DimEq`'s `A extends B` check distributes over a union DIM VALUE (e.g. a
 * single axis typed `2 | 3`) with no filter — the pre-existing `MatMul`
 * latent hazard this design pass discovered and deliberately leaves
 * unfixed (FOLLOWUPS). `VectorLenCheck` below filters union dims FIRST via
 * the newly-exported `IsUnion` (literal-arithmetic.ts, Spike-04/06 house rule) —
 * a union dim on either side is *never* misread as a verdict, it degrades
 * to "no claim" instead, same as a dynamic (`number`) dim.

 * — not caught by `RankUnknowable`, which only fires for mixed-RANK unions)
 * is ALSO widened here, via the `IsUnion<Head>` branch — REVISED after a

 * an earlier revision of this type left such a `Head` to "distribute
 * naturally" through the naked `Head extends readonly [infer D extends
 * Dim]` check below, reasoning by analogy to `DotCheckStatic`'s own
 * union-of-whole-shapes precedent in this file. That analogy does NOT hold
 * here: `DotCheckStatic` runs the distributed check exactly ONCE per call
 * (a single rank confirmation), so each distributed branch resolves to an
 * independent, self-contained verdict. `StackFold` instead THREADS one
 * branch's distributed value (`D`) into the NEXT recursive call's `Acc`
 * parameter — so distribution at one row silently forks the ENTIRE REST OF
 * THE FOLD into parallel per-member continuations that can each reach a
 * DIFFERENT verdict (e.g. one member's `D` agrees with a later row, the
 * other's doesn't), producing a MIXED union of a real `Dim` and a
 * `ShapeError` as `StackFold`'s overall result. `Guard`'s tuple-wrapped
 * `[Result] extends [ShapeError<infer M>]` check (ndarray.ts) rejects only
 * a UNIFORM error union — a mixed one falls through to `Actual` (accepted),
 * and `StackShape`'s `Extract<StackFold<Shapes>, Dim>` then silently drops
 * the `ShapeError` member and keeps the surviving literal `Dim` — exactly
 * the CONFIDENTLY WRONG result M2 forbids: `NDArray.stack([fixed, union])`
 * compiled clean with a specific literal `D` that the runtime call could
 * (and empirically did) reject. This is the SAME failure shape `reduce.ts`'s
 * own `ReduceAxis` documents for its `IsUnion<Axis>` filter (see that type's
 * doc comment) — a union that survives past a naked distributive check
 * partially, with the losing branch's `ShapeError` silently discarded
 * downstream. The fix is the same one `ReduceAxis` already applies: gate on
 * `IsUnion<Head>` BEFORE the naked `Head extends readonly [infer D]` check.
 * POSITION IS LOAD-BEARING, same as `ReduceAxis`'s own filter: the moment
 * execution reaches the naked check, a union `Head` has ALREADY been
 * distributed member-by-member — a filter placed after that point would see
 * only single members, never the union as a whole (this is exactly the
 * mechanism the Verify-B finding proved). Result: a union-shaped row NEVER
 * produces a `ShapeError`, not even when EVERY member would individually
 * mismatch (the "double-mismatch" case) — the fold degrades uniformly to
 * `readonly [N, number]` no-claim instead, and the runtime backstop
 * (`stackRuntime`) stays authoritative for what the type layer can no
 * longer prove. This also fixes the STEM-union side effect a partial
 * distribution would otherwise cause on a genuine double mismatch (two
 * DIFFERENT `ShapeError` messages combining into one confusing union
 * message) — there is now only ever Pass or `Extract<..., Dim>`, never a
 * `ShapeError` union, out of this fold when a union `Head` is involved.
 *
 * Terminates (`Rows` exhausted) by returning `Acc`. Always a real `Dim` in
 * practice: the caller (`StackCheck`/`StackShape` below) gates the
 * empty-tuple case (F3) BEFORE ever invoking this fold, so `Rows` is never
 * `[]` on the very first call — `"none"` is never actually observable as a
 * final result, but the type stays honest about the parameter's full range

// Op-Scheibe W5 (docs/op-w5-item-spec.md, D2/D4 + the Baustein-0 addendum
// F1-F8): `ItemGuard<S, Idx>` — the `item(...indices)` REST-PARAMETER type.
// `item` needs full indexing (one literal/dynamic index per axis, D1), so
// its guard differs from `slice.ts`'s `SliceSpecsGuard` in exactly the ways
// the addendum's findings pin down:
//
//  - F1 (BLOCKER, fixed): a `Guard<Result, Actual>`-style rest-parameter
//    (ndarray.ts's `Guard`, which collapses its whole error branch to a
//    single non-array `{ __shapeError }` object) is a permanent TS2370 AT
//    THE METHOD DECLARATION when used as a rest-parameter type — confirmed
//    empirically by the Baustein-0 verifier, the exact reason
//    `SliceSpecsGuard` already exists as a tuple-shaped alternative
//    instead of reusing `Guard` directly. `ItemGuard` follows that same
//    tuple-shaped discipline: every branch stays an array/tuple type, only
//    individual ELEMENTS are ever retyped to the branded error object
//    (`ItemMark` below) — never the whole rest-parameter type.
//  - F2: the fold below is S-DRIVEN (recurses over `S`, not `Idx`) — an
//    Idx-driven fold (`SliceSpecsGuard`'s own idiom) silently accepts
//    under-arity, which is exactly right THERE (partial indexing is
//    `slice`'s whole point) and exactly WRONG here (`item` requires full
//    indexing, D1): once `Idx` is exhausted before `S` is, `ItemFoldAcc`
//    keeps filling the remaining position(s) with a plain `number` marker
//    instead of stopping, so the guard's own returned tuple TYPE always has
//    exactly `S["length"]` elements, regardless of how many arguments were
//    actually supplied.
//  - F3: that fixed-length shape is what makes arity mismatches (too few OR
//    too many indices) a NATIVE `tsc` diagnostic (TS2554, "Expected N
//    arguments, but got M") at the call site — there is architecturally no
//    argument POSITION to hang a custom `__shapeError` message on for a
//    *missing* argument, so unlike the bounds/dot-form checks below, arity
//    is NOT a custom stem at the type layer (`itemRuntime`, runtime.ts,
//    still throws its OWN gepinnt arity message for gradual/dynamic-rank
//    callers the type layer can't check statically). Verified: `item()` on
//    a rank-0 `S = []` compiles (the fold immediately bottoms out at `Acc =
//    []`, a zero-length declared tuple); `item(0)` on the same receiver is
//    TS2554, not a custom message.
//  - F4 (regression found + fixed): without an explicit dynamic-length gate,
//    a SPREAD call (`nd.item(...someNumberArray)`, `someNumberArray: number[]`)
//    breaks with TS2556 ("A spread argument must either have a tuple type
//    or be passed to a rest parameter") once the rest-parameter type is
//    forced to a fixed-length tuple — `slice.ts`'s `SliceSpecsGuard` avoids
//    this via its own `IsDynamicLength` gate; `ItemGuard` reuses
//    `IsDynamicRank` (dim.ts) directly instead of duplicating that helper,
//    since `Idx` (`readonly number[]`) is structurally a `Shape`
//    (`readonly Dim[]`) already — same "is this tuple's length statically
//    unknown" probe, no new type needed. A dynamic-length `Idx` degrades
//    wholly to no-claim (gradual, `itemRuntime` backstops it at runtime).

 *     alone is already MORE conservative than a naive reading of its own
 *     doc comment suggests (a uniformly-out-of-bounds union still resolves
 *     to `"unknown"`, not `"out"`), so this pre-gate is not merely

 *     TEMPLATE-LITERAL string built from `I`, which itself distributes over
 *     a union `I` the same naked way) nor `LiteralIndexBounds` would flag.
 *  2. `IsDotFormStep<\`${I}\`>` — a provable non-integer literal (`1.5`,
 *     `-1.5`; F5). NOT covered by `LiteralIndexBounds` itself: that type's
 *     own doc comment documents `1.5`-shaped inputs as `IsPlainDigits`
 *     failures, falling through to its `"unknown"` (silent-pass) branch —
 *     dot-form rejection needs this SEPARATE, dedicated check, reusing the
 *     exact classifier `LiteralStepInvalid` (literal-arithmetic.ts) already
 *     uses for the structurally identical `slice()` step case.
 *  3. `LiteralIndexBounds<I, D>` (literal-arithmetic.ts, Spike 03) — the
 *     NumPy-negative-aware bounds verdict (`"out"` only for a PROVABLY
 *     out-of-range literal index against a literal dim; `"in"`/`"unknown"`
 *     both pass through, same never-wrong-only-incomplete discipline every

 * — `ItemGuard`'s own declared return type stays array-shaped either way
